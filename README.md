<br><br><h2>🌱About Our Idea!🌱</h2>
<h3>🚨A Disaster Detection & Response Support System: The combination of Embedded Boards and SW</h3>

<h3>🚨Background of Development</h3>

: Announced by UNDRR the number of disasters on Earth  is increasing  as the climate crisis becomes serious.<br>
👉 As the Earth's climate deteriorates, the frequency of disasters increases, and accordingly, our team AdEco designed a **Disaster Detecton and Resonse System**<br><br>

<h3>🚨Expectation Effectiveness</h3>

: According to data from the `SENDAI FRAMEWORK`, 14 out of 195 countries have multiple risk early warning systems, and only `0.46%` of the world has `predictive systems`.<br>
👉 So by deploying this system in each country, we can make a world that's `predicted by disasters`.

<h3>🚨Disaster Lists to be Detected & Sensors to be used </h3>

: Announced by UNDRR the number of disasters on Earth  is increasing  as the climate crisis becomes serious.<br>
👉 As the Earth's climate deteriorates, the frequency of disasters increases, and accordingly, our team AdEco designed a **Disaster Detecton and Resonse System**<br><br>

<h3>🚨Flow Charts & Disaster Detection Algorithms</h3>

: According to data from the `SENDAI FRAMEWORK`, 14 out of 195 countries have multiple risk early warning systems, and only `0.46%` of the world has `predictive systems`.<br>
